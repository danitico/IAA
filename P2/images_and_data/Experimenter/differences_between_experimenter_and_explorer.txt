The Experimenter operates differently from the Explorer.
The Explorer sums evaluation metrics over the folds of the cross validation - e.g. percent correct is computed by summing all 
the correctly classified instances over the test folds and then dividing by the total number of instances. 
The Experimenter, on the other hand, computes averages over the folds. 
Furthermore, the default in the Experimenter is to run 10 repetitions of 10-fold cross-validation (so 100 folds are averaged over).
